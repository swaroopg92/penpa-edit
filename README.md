### Clone
* Opens the puzzle in new link in new tab. Its like making a copy/duplicate of the Puzzle.

### I/O Sudoku
* This function is to allow the flexibility of Importing and Exporting a Sudoku. It supports Import and Export to https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm solver.
	* Import Sudoku
		* Type the input string in the text area which contains digits (0-9) where 0 or (.) is used for an empty cell. No spaces in the string. The number of digits entered should be a perfect square. Basically (1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81) is allowed. That is grid size of 1x1 to 9x9.
		* If its default sudoku grid created from the New Grid options then Penpa automatically knows the position of the Sudoku grid.
		* User can also select a square portion of the grid and import the digits. User needs to specify the location of the first cell in terms of Row and Column. Then specify the Sudoku gridsize (Size:). Default is 9x9.
	* Export Sudoku
		* If its default sudoku grid created from the New Grid options then Penpa automatically knows the position of the Sudoku grid.
		* User can also select a square portion of the grid and export the digits. User needs to specify the location of the first cell in terms of Row and Column. Then specify the Sudoku gridsize (Size:). Default is 9x9.
		* Ignore Pencil Marks - Sometimes we want to export the Sudoku grid in the middle of the solve. Checkmark this option and then export to ignore the Corner and Centre digits used while solving.
		* Pressing Export button also automatically copies the output string to the clipboard.

### Load
* This function has multiple purposes. Mainly, it is a solution for "URL too long Error".
* If the puzzle is too big and contains a lot of elements, it generates a big URL and the size is limited by the internet. In order to address this issue, one can use this Load button option to copy the big URL and click "Load URL" button.
* Basically, one can share the "Long URL" and ask the user to copy paste in the "Load" button and load the puzzle locally into Penpa.
* Secondly, it can also be used to import https://puzz.link/db/ puzzles. Those with a :heavy_check_mark: the right of the name are supported while those marked with :x: are not (yet).
